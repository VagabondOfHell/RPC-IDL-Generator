# RPC-IDL-Generator
Generates the IDL and ADC files for RPC

During schooling I was placed in charge of the networking group. None of us had networking experience or knowledge.
I explored using RPC before designing the Network Library we ended up using. When I was looking at RPC, I had followed
this tutorial: http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/4837/Introduction-to-RPC-Part-1. Eventually I decided to make a tool
that would generate the IDL and ADC files for me, which is what this is. This is that tool.
